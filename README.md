# Perception-augmented Hidden Markov Model
This repository contains the codes for reproducing results in "A Perception-augmented Hidden Markov Model for Family Management of Diabetes". There are three main components:
1. Folder `Application` contains codes for analyzing FMOD trail data and reproducing results in Section 2 and 5
2. Folder `Simulation` contains codes for reproducing results of simulation studies in Section 6
3. `DHMM_*.R` are the main functions implementing the proposed method and `MHMM_*.R` implement the method introduced in Raffa and Dubin(2015) for the purpose of comparison
